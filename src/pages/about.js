          Thank you very much for visiting Japan Life Stories!
        </h2>

        <p className="mt-12 md:mt-20">
          Our platform started after hearing dozens of foreigners, from all
          nationalities and walks of life, ask the same question:
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-lg pt-8 pb-4 text-center">
          "How can I start a life in Japan?"
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          Some were motivated by a passion for the country, others by family
          reasons but all were facing the same issue: the lack of insights on
          how to get started.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          The paperwork-heavy administration, complex layers in interpersonal
          communication, extensive language nuances and a very unique culture
          quickly add up, forming an overwhelming amount of challenges.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5">
          In a similar situation, there is nothing more valuable than listening
          to the feedbacks of people who went through the exact same process,
          walked the exact same paths and found their way through the maze.
          Often very personal ways.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl mt-10">
          To share the knowledge of foreigners who built a successful life in
          Japan!

          While a few great blogs and platforms also understood this need and
          specialised in niche areas like startups & entrepreneurship, we chose
          diversity. We decided to share the stories of foreigners only, all
          from many different backgrounds, for one reason:{" "}
