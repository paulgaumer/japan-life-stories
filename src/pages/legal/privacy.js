      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Japan Life Stories collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Japan Life Stories's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how Japan Life Stories's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, Japan Life Stories may
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan Life Stories also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on https://japanlifestories.com blog
        posts. Japan Life Stories only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
        addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Japan Life Stories's websites choose to interact
        with Japan Life Stories in ways that require Japan Life Stories to
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
        information that Japan Life Stories gathers depends on the nature of the
        interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://japanlifestories.com to provide a username and email address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but

        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
